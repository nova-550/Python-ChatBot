# 🧠 Rule-Based Chatbot in Python

A simple, beginner-friendly chatbot built using Python's `if-elif-else` statements. This chatbot simulates a basic conversation based on user input, showcasing fundamental programming concepts like control flow, loops, and input handling.

## 📌 Project Overview

This chatbot is a text-based assistant that responds to specific user inputs with pre-defined replies. It's not connected to any database or AI engine—just pure logic flow built on simple Python conditions.

### ✨ Features

- Console-based chatbot interface
- Keyword-triggered responses
- Continuous conversation loop until "exit" or "bye"
- Error handling for unknown inputs

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the script file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-based-chatbot.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rule-based-chatbot
3. Run the chatbot:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
4. Start chatting! Type messages like:
    ```bash
    - hello
    - how are you
    - who are you
    - bye

## 🧪 Sample Conversation
    You: hello  
    Bot: Hello there! How can I assist you today?

    You: what can you do?  
    Bot: I can chat with you using pre-defined logic!

    You: bye  
    Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- while loops for continuous interaction
- if-elif-else for decision-making
- input() and print() for communication
- Lowercasing user input for better matching

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- ✅ GUI version using Tkinter
- 🔮 AI/ML integration using NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy
- 📚 Support for a dynamic FAQ database
- 🤖 Add context awareness or memory of past questions
